## Dataset Description

This project uses the **Olist Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset**, a real-world dataset that contains transactional data from a multi-vendor e-commerce platform in Brazil.

The dataset includes information on orders, customers, payments, products, and reviews, enabling end-to-end analysis of the e-commerce funnel.

This dataset simulates a real-world e-commerce data warehouse with normalized relational tables, similar to production analytics environments.
